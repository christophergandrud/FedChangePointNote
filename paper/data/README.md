# Creating Scrutiny Indictors: Data

1 August 2014

The files in this directory contain the data used in the paper's analyses.

## Main Data

Two CSV files contain the main data:

- *[HouseFullHearings.csv](HouseFullHearings.csv)*: data pertaining to the US House of Representatives

- *[SenateFullHearings.csv](SenateFullHearings.csv)*: data pertaining to the US Senate

Please see the working paper pages 2-4 and page 6 for a discussion of the testimony data, including sources. See pages 10-11 for a discussion of the economic data and sources.

The data sets were created using source code and raw data files found in the *[builder](builder/)* subdirectory.

## Bills Note

In addition the *[Bills](Bills/)* directory contains data from [Binder (2014)](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/07/08/audit-the-fed-on-steroids/) and a short note comparing the hearing-based change point indicators to a legislative proposal focused way of measuring scrutiny.
