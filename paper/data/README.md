# Creating Scrutiny Indictors: Data

The files in this directory contain the data used in the [paper's analyses](FedChangePointNote/paper/source/MainAnalysis_Figures.R).

## Main Data

Two CSV files contain the main data:

- *[HouseFullHearings.csv](FedChangePointNote/paper/data/HouseFullHearings.csv)*: data pertaining to the US House of Representatives

- *[SenateFullHearings.csv](FedChangePointNote/paper/data/SenateFullHearings.csv)*: data pertaining to the US Senate

Please see [the working paper](FedChangePointNote/paper/ChangPointCongFed.pdf) pages 2-4 for a discussion of the testimony data, including source. See pages 10-11 for a discussion of the economic data and sources.

## Bills Note

In addition the *[Bills](Bills/)* directory contains a short note comparing the hearing-based change point indicators to a legislative proposal focused way of measuring scrutiny.
