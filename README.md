## Description

We investigate trends in Congressional scrutiny of the US Federal Reserve from the late 1990s through 2012. Though independent, the Federal Reserve (the Fed) is accountable to legislative principles. Our aim is to develop indicators of high and low scrutiny to gain an understanding of the political stressors that the Fed is under and which can be used in future research to examine how the Fed responds to pressures from legislators. We use change point analysis to estimate periods of high and low legislative scrutiny for both the US House of Representatives and Senate. Surprisingly, though the Senate has the power to approve Fed appointments, their scrutiny of the Fed does not seen to noticeably change over our observation period. The House Committee on Financial Services did noticeably increase its scrutiny of the Fed during the recent financial crisis. The paper also provides an introduction to how multivariate change point analysis could be used to estimate latent legislative scrutiny states.
